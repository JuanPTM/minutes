## Agenda

* Howto continue with ORT (@itrich)
* Our vision for CloudMon (@fkr)


## ORT

* @itrich built an example pipeline with github actions
  * @garloff suggest to add this to the project board and add it to the sprint planning
  * further work should then build up on this
  * @itrich will move his POC pipeline to the scs namespace
  * @itrich points out that the dificil part is to come up with the rulesets for ORT
  * the scs project should define the policy (rules implementation may be delegated)
  Current high-level policy: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/Docs/blob/main/Design-Docs/OSS-Health.md
  * meta repo that pulls in all other repos

## Vision for CloudMon

* Current CloudMon as built by OTC is single-tenant (two views, one internal, one external)
* Multi-tenancy would be useful for SCS context (centralized, public service)
  * Compare clouds
  * Support each other (Open Ops)
  * May even be a value-add service from the SCS project to providers
  * May help with transparency required for SCS OpenOps certification
    * The framework (ansible playbooks runtime :-)) can als be used to just check SCS compatibility
  * SCS can not provide 99.9+% SLAs (24x7) from OSB Alliance
    * Could be delegated to providers
* Centralization could happen at different levels
  * Job-runner, database (graphite), visualization/dashboards (grafana)
  * If only visualization is centralized, it might not have high SLA reqs (as providers with high SLA reqs can have their own highly available in addition)
* Large Clouds might want to have it to have their SLA checked (private instance)
  * single tenant installs then
* Smaller Clouds might just rely on the central one?
