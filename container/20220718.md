## Security of root CA keys in SCS clusters

- Worth differenciating between implementation and standard?
- aside from this specific issue, how and where should we tackle such discussions?
  - one goal of scs (as stated by @fkr) is to improve upstream so in cases like these the discussion upstream should be taken up
  - not an issue with kubeadm but within the bootstrap provider (eg. cluster api)
  - the issue does not only affect cluster api clusters, but also the initial cluster api cluster, which is bootstrapped by kind (kubernetes in docker). so all clusters rolled out by ref. implementation are affected
- the kind cluster needs to get rid off
- loft.sh ?
- gonicus & syself to work on a architecture overview once Sven gave his presentation on operator-based approach to lifecycle mgmt of capi clusters


## discussion on declarative vs. api based approaches

- remark that we had a talk on a unified scs api, which should be continued
- declarative is nice if you control the operator
