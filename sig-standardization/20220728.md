## Topics today (2022-07-28)


### Goals for today
* Identify work packages and owners
* Delegate work packages into teams IaaS/KaaS/IAM+Ops as appropriate
* Announce overflow Discussion  OpenStack Roles Controller, Compute Network
-> Best practices for implementing reference for Operators, not a Standard
* How to certify managed k8s offerings?

Discussion: SCS goals at container level: Standardized way to describe wanted clusters

* API required to request clusters
* Service models:
    * Managed k8s offerings: Operator uses API internally to create and manage clusters for customers
    * API used by customers themselves for self-service
    * Shared responsibility models are possible as well
* Helpful to use personas to structure the service model discussion
* There is a common set of requirements for consumers of managed clusters
* Who owns management cluster?
    * Parameters are irrelevant if not exposed to end-user ... (but UI only with limited choices)

-> Focus on API first approach for now with Self-Service capability
    -> Managed k8s offerings come later

Open question: Do we want providers to have a pre-provisioned CAPI Management Endpoint?

### Overall process
* Agree on best practices
* Find broad support from providers/community
* Define standards & recommendations (aka optional and possibly future standards)
* Implement tests (-> VP10) for provider CI/monitoring integration
    * Zuul or CloudMon or ?
* Issue SCS certificates (compliant/sovereign/open)

### Standards vs Extensions
* Allow extensions
    * To avoid slowing down innovation to speed of standardization
    * Features need to have ability to be experimented with and proven prior to becoming standardized
    * Possible differentiators for providers (though dangerous)
* Try to ensure extensions are always consumed after a conscious decisions
    * Need to be explicitly enabled
    * Naming makes extension character clear
    * Issue warnings
    * Compliance tool will annotate / warn

Discussion:
    * How to provide visibility about extension from Operator to SCS?
    * Important feedback to SCS project!
    * Self-descriptions could serve this purpose ...
    * Potentially anonimized and statistically aggregated when large numbers of small envs emerge

### IaaS standards (optional!)
Existing:

* [OpenStack powered guidelines](https://www.openstack.org/brand/interop/) as baseline
    * Will only fulfill OpenStack powered compute at this point (storage with radosgw fails one test)
* [Image Metadata (and suggested naming)](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/Docs/blob/main/Design-Docs/Image-Properties-Spec.md)
* [Flavor naming (and mandatory standard flavors)](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/Docs/blob/main/Design-Docs/flavor-naming.md)
    * Too fine grained for smaller providers (creates too long flavor list to expose all capabilities)
    * Should we recommend to use short generic names (which are compatible with spec as is) and in addition create a possibility to make properties discoverable using extra_specs?
      => User Story for team1

To be done?

* External networks, network names, SNAT, other provider networks, DHCP
* Local DNS, NTP services (-> DHCP, Self-descriptions?)
* SMTP: Gateway, port blocking (Self-descriptions)
* Meta/User-Data service (for cloud-init) need to work!
* Quota requirements?
* Users have ability to get domain? Should be default!?
    * Role/permissions that allow user management, role management (within domain), federation
    * Project deletion capability
* Meaning of AZs?
    * Significantly higher availability for multi-AZ deployments by independent infrastructure (switches, fire protection zone, power delivery, internet connection, ...)
    * What is shared between AZs?
      [ ] OpenStack Networks
      [ ] Block Storage
* Storage classes?

=> General bi-weekly sessions for SIG Standardization, Bi-weekly deep-dives (in alternate weeks) for IaaS / KaaS / IAM / ...


### KaaS standards
* Cluster description as yaml
    * Heavily inspired by cluster-api (but less low level, more at clusterctl.yaml / values.yaml level)
    * Can be implemented without c-api (e.g. gardener)
* Operator approach
    * Tool that reconciles wanted cluster with reality
    [* Ref impl will use c-api, -provider, CCM, CCM-extension/Library]
* Optional gitops support (wanted clulster descriptions retrieved from git)
* Standard properties of clusters
    * Metrics and gateway/ingress services are a mandatory (for providers) option (for end users)
    * Selectable k8s versions
    * 1/3/5/7... control nodes, N worker nodes selectable
    * Persistent storage provider (default name?)
    * Storage classes?
    * CNI with network policies
    * k8s style usage (not cilium/calico - specific)
    * Warnings for non-standard usage
    * Optional for providers (and users) but with a standard name:
    * ...


### IAM standards
* Support federation
    * Keystone gets identites from keycloak via OIDC
    * Local keycloak can be used as well as remote one
    * Local keycloak can be exposed for other (SCS) clouds as IdP
    * Local keycloak can get IDs from other OIDC IdPs (keycloak and non-keycloak)
* Vision: Can be configured for own OpenStack domain / keycloak realm as self-service
* Open: Optionally use identites / roles / authorizations from IaaS for CaaS / KaaS
