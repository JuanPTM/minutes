## Agenda

### Progress review ...
* Domain admin role learnings from [(Public Cloud SIG) Monday](https://input.scs.community/2023-domain-manager-role-with-openstack)
    * Agreement on "we should have this"
    * No clear understanding of the status nor a clear way forward
        * CSPs have their specific workarounds, hence no big interest to invest into cleaning up past pain
        * SCS investment opportunity
    * Reseller approach would require more features than the current domain admin role, possibly implementable via the hierarchical projects
    * Fact finding: Current domain admin role being secure? (@gtema believes it is, @jchousterman disagrees, at least other domains/projects are visible)
        * Hack session wanted to clarify
        * to verify this will work https://docs.openstack.org/security-guide/identity/domains.html
        * plan this for Fri 2023-06-16
* [#317](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/317), PR [#284](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/284) proposed PS onboarding dom/group/roles/project schema needs review (@garloff)
    * First comments in
    * Doc may need to be prefixed with "what are the roles?"
        * Should incorporate the input from OpenStack domain manager role (AI @garloff add link from Mon)
        * Separate ADR, create issue @garloff
* [#293](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/293) dev auth code flow PKCE. Waiting for [upstream](https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/keystoneauth/+/883852) reactions?
    * ping by @reqa in keystone [IRC meeting](https://meetings.opendev.org/meetings/keystone/2023/keystone.2023-06-06-15.04.log.txt) (who could not participate live)
    * will be looked at this week
* [#254](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/254) IDP features ADR. Stabilize: [#302](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/pull/302), mail sent (2 weeks deadline)
* How to route user from horizon to his domain/realm/IdP, custom discovery page [#314](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues/314)
    * Background: We use a proxy-realm here to avoid keystone container restart need
    * horizon: username with email, look-up email domain to identify keycloak realm to redirect
* Another attempt to avoid keystone restarts
    * https://docs.openstack.org/keystone/zed/admin/configuration.html#enable-drivers-for-storing-configuration-options-in-sql-database
    "Unlike the file-based method of specifying domain-specific configurations, options specified via the Identity API will become active without needing to restart the keystone server. "
    * this does unfortunately NOT cover the connections to external IdPs, according to @reqa's assessment
    * continue to seek for a simple solution for this ...

### Exchange with DAASI (fkr)
* Peter Gietz (@DAASI) interested in our work
    * We should give him a short overview before inviting him into the team meets
    * Hacking session / Lightning Talk / ... ?
    * @fkr to coordinate apptmt
