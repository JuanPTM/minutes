## Paragraph on "Weâ€™re transparent about our incidents"

- Start with reference to "We believe that failures.." and highlight that transparency should always be blameless!
- Status page with link to a unique identifier that covers the current/past incident
- Incidents don't expire. Be transparent about the history. Let other learn from your past failures.
- Report about the incidents openly: what happened, how did we solve the incident and what are plans to improve our services?
- The incident report should target both: technical as well as non-technical customers with a TL;DR section and a detailed/technical description that covers all the nerdy details.
- Use well-established guidelines (e.g. Google SRE, Atlassian Blameless Postmortem, etc.)
- Reductions (e.g. internal notes vs. public statement) are okay to avoid blaming people directly.
- Finish the chapter with a hint that our proposal is based on parts of the SRE movement (and give kudos)
- Stress that we encourage signing organizations to act acording to the SRE guideline

Friederike will condense the above items to a paragraph on incident transparency. Further discussion will take place in the corresponding issue: https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/open-operations-manifesto/issues/5
